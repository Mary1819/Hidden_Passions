  <h1 class="title-art">History of Art</h1>
  <p>Knowing design history gives context to our contemporary visual cultureâ€”we can use the past to decode the present
    and forecast a stylistic future.
    It allows you to make a positive first impression on potential customers.
    Design influences what we think, the way we feel and the decisions we make.
    It can help search for new solutions and come up with new ideas. These new ideas can lead to better designs that are
    more imaginative, interactive, and user-friendly.
